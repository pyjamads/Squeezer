EXAMPLES

1.    Breakout Demo - A simple breakout clone, the "Original" scene contains no effects, I recommend checking out the "StepByStep" scene and stepping through all the versions of effects by pressing the "Return key" after hitting play in the editor. NOTE: Some of the scenes have been left in rough states after code has changed within the past year.

2.    Platformer Demo - NOTE: Don't even try these ones, it was an early demo, and it has not been kept updated.

3.    DISC ROOM Demo - a DISC ROOM clone, made from assets provided in the DISC ROOM launch GAME JAM, it has a Jam version, with all effects and sounds implemented using Squeezer, but using the assets from the tutorial package. Besides it has an "evolution" version, which has no effects, and an Evolution Load in scene, meant to be dropped into the scene heirarchy with the Evolution scene, this allows you to run the Interactive Evolution mode of Squeezer, and evolve effects for the game's various triggers.
